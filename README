          WordNet Blast
=====================================================================

In memory access to the wordnet onthology.

DEPENDENCIES:
        boost 1.46

INSTALL:
        cmake CMakeLists.txt
        make

USAGE:
        #include "wordnet.hh"

        using namespace std;
        using namespace wnb;

        int main()
        {
                wordnet wn(PATH_TO_WORDNET);

                vector<synset> synsets1 = wn.get_synsets("cat");
                vector<synset> synsets2 = wn.get_synsets("dog");

                nltk_similarity similarity(wn);
                float d = similarity(synsets1[0], synsets2[0], 6);
        }

BUGS:
        - Word morphing is currently not called ( morphword(cword,p) ).
          Morphing can be used but still relies on the original wordnet,
          file-oriented, library, and thus is a lot slower than it could
          be. Access to wordnet without morphing will fail in most cases.

          Morphing can be made in-memory easily. I am currently lacking
          of time: Contact me if you would like to use the library.
